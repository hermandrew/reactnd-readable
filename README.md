# reactnd-readable
Second project for the React Nanodegree from Udacity

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a more complete knowledge of React than our first project, and to implement a good data handling strategy using API calls and [redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management in the application itself.

In the application, the user has a basic message posting setup, where they can read and sort posts by category on the Left-Hand Side, and interact with the posts on the middle and Right-Hand Side of the content.

The application should be fully featured, including CRUD operations for Posts and Comments on Posts.

## Folders
1. [API Server](./api-server)- The project-defined API service, forked from Udacity's starter project.
2. [Front-End](./frontend)- The front end application for this project.  In order to test the front end, simply clone the repository, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and issue the command `npm start` via the command line.
